WORDLE SOLVER

https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

Your task is to create a `solve_wordle` function that takes in a wordle puzzle
and an initial guess, solves the puzzle, and returns the word.

A `Wordle` class has been provided for you, which has a `guess` method that
takes in a word and returns a clue. The clue is a string of 5 characters,
where each character is one of:
- ðŸŸ©: The letter is in the correct position
- ðŸŸ¨: The letter is in the word, but not in the correct position
- â¬œ: The letter is not in the word

With 'proper' Wordle, you would have 6 guesses to solve the puzzle. However,
this restriction has not been implemented here. You can make as many guesses as
you like (though in all likelihood, your `solve_wordle` function won't need
more than 6).

Obviously, your `solve_wordle` function should not access the `Wordle` object's
`.secret` attribute directly. That would be cheating. You should only use the 
`.guess` method to get clues.

BONUS:
At the moment, initialising a `Wordle` object with a word results in one being
chosen at random from `WORDS`. You could change this behaviour to use the 
NY Times API to pull today's word, add it to `WORDS` if it isn't already there,
and *then* solve the puzzle.

The API URL is:
https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/YYYY-MM-DD.json
(replacing YYYY-MM-DD with today's date)
