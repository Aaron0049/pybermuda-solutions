# PyBermuda Challenges

This repository contains scripts for small Python challenges to try, and subsequently discuss, at PyBermuda meetups.

## Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies for all challenges, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If, on the way through, you add a new dependency, you can update the `requirements.txt` file by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
